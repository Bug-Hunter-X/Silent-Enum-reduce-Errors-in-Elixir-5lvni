This repository demonstrates a subtle bug that can occur when using `Enum.reduce` in Elixir. The problem arises when the function passed to `Enum.reduce` doesn't handle all potential inputs gracefully, leading to unexpected results without explicit error messages.  The example showcases a scenario where a conditional statement within the reduce function may not be comprehensive enough, allowing for unnoticed errors. The solution demonstrates the use of a more robust function that explicitly addresses potential issues and provides better error handling.
